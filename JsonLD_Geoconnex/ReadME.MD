# WestDAAT JsonLD Schema for Geoconnex

# Template
https://github.com/WSWCWaterDataExchange/WestDAAT/blob/develop/src/API/WesternStatesWater.WestDaat.Utilities/Resources/GeoConnexJsonLDTemplate.json

The reason why we created this massive graph file for all of our WaDE sites (landing pages) is to avoid the Geoconnex crawler from hitting our landing pages, which would be 2 million hits to our maptielr subscription and cost us a fortune each time the crawler runs.  

# JSON-LD file, updated monthly.
